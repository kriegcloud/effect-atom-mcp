## Code Review Checklist

When reviewing completed tasks, use this comprehensive checklist:

### 1. Effect Pattern Compliance (from AGENTS.md)

```markdown
## Effect Patterns Review

- [ ] **Effect.gen usage**: All Effect code uses Effect.gen (not raw constructors)
- [ ] **yield* syntax**: Properly uses `yield*` to run Effects
- [ ] **return yield* with fail**: Uses `return yield*` with Effect.fail/die for type narrowing
- [ ] **Effect.fn usage**: Uses Effect.fn for functions returning Effects (with span names)
- [ ] **Effect.try**: Uses Effect.try instead of try/catch in Effect.gen
- [ ] **Service pattern**: Services use Effect.Service class with scoped option
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Dependencies listed in dependencies array
- [ ] **as const**: Service returns use `as const`
- [ ] **Single Effect.provide**: Only one Effect.provide in application
- [ ] **Layer.mergeAll**: Combines layers with Layer.mergeAll (not chained provides)
```

### 2. Code Quality

```markdown
## Code Quality Review

- [ ] **TypeScript strict mode**: Code compiles without errors
- [ ] **Type safety**: No `any` types without justification
- [ ] **Error handling**: All errors use Schema.TaggedError
- [ ] **Observability**: Effect.fn used for spans, Effect.log for logging
- [ ] **Documentation**: Code is well-commented
- [ ] **Consistent style**: Follows existing code style
- [ ] **No console.log**: Uses Effect.log instead
- [ ] **Proper imports**: All imports present and correct
```

### 3. Task-Specific Requirements

```markdown
## Task Requirements Review

- [ ] **Files modified**: Only files specified in task
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**: All criteria met
- [ ] **Examples work**: Code examples compile and are correct
- [ ] **Tests**: Tests added if specified in task
- [ ] **MCP integration**: Resources/tools accessible if applicable
- [ ] **No regressions**: Existing functionality still works
```

### 4. Documentation Quality (for doc tasks)

```markdown
## Documentation Review

- [ ] **Completeness**: Covers all aspects of the topic
- [ ] **Accuracy**: Information is correct and verified
- [ ] **Examples**: 2-3 examples provided (basic to advanced)
- [ ] **Code validity**: All code examples are valid TypeScript
- [ ] **Cross-references**: Links to related docs work
- [ ] **Clarity**: Explanations are clear and well-structured
- [ ] **Formatting**: Proper markdown formatting
```

### 5. atom-react Specific (M1 tasks)

```markdown
## atom-react Compliance Review

- [ ] **Verified APIs**: Only uses the 11 verified hooks
- [ ] **No useAtomEffect**: Doesn't reference non-existent hooks
- [ ] **Registry access**: Uses React.useContext(RegistryContext) (not useRegistry hook)
- [ ] **RegistryProvider**: Examples include RegistryProvider setup
- [ ] **Suspense**: Properly demonstrates React Suspense integration
- [ ] **Effect integration**: Shows Effect service integration correctly
```

### 6. Performance & Best Practices

```markdown
## Performance & Best Practices

- [ ] **Efficient patterns**: No obvious performance issues
- [ ] **Memory leaks**: Proper cleanup (useEffect, unsubscribe, etc.)
- [ ] **Error boundaries**: Error handling demonstrated where appropriate
- [ ] **Security**: No security anti-patterns
- [ ] **Scalability**: Code scales reasonably
```

```

### Scenario 2: Agent's Code Doesn't Follow Effect Patterns

```markdown
## Code Pattern Guidance

I see some patterns that don't align with Effect best practices. Let me help!

### Issue: [Not Using Effect.gen]

**Your Code**:
\`\`\`typescript
// Their code
\`\`\`

**Effect Pattern** (from AGENTS.md):
\`\`\`typescript
// Correct pattern
Effect.gen(function* () {
  const result = yield* someEffect
  return result
})
\`\`\`

**Why This Matters**: [Explanation]

### Issue: [Another pattern]
[Same structure]

### Resources
- AGENTS.md lines [X-Y]: [Pattern guide]
- Example in existing code: [File] lines [X-Y]

### Rework Plan
[Step-by-step instructions to fix]

### After Fixing
Run these to verify:
\`\`\`bash
npm run build  # Should compile
\`\`\`

Questions? Just ask! These patterns take practice.
```

### Scenario 3: Agent Can't Find Required Information

```markdown
## Finding Required Information

You need [specific information]. Here's how to get it:

### Option 1: Use MCP Tools
\`\`\`json
// Search Effect documentation
{ "tool": "mcp_effect_docs_effect_docs_search", "query": "[query]" }

// Get specific doc
{ "tool": "mcp_effect_docs_get_effect_doc", "documentId": [id] }
\`\`\`

Expected result: [What you'll find]

### Option 2: Check Project Files
- **AGENTS.md** lines [X-Y]: [What's there]
- **RESEARCH.md** section [X.Y]: [What's there]
- **Existing code** in [file]: [What's there]

### Option 3: Verify from Source
\`\`\`json
{
  "tool": "mcp_github_get_file_contents",
  "owner": "tim-smart",
  "repo": "effect-atom",
  "path": "[path]"
}
\`\`\`

### What You're Looking For
[Specific thing to look for in the results]

Try Option 1 first. If that doesn't work, let me know what you found!
```

### Scenario 4: TypeScript Compilation Errors

```markdown
## Debugging Compilation Errors

Let's fix these TypeScript errors systematically.

### Error Analysis
\`\`\`
[Paste their error]
\`\`\`

### Root Cause
[Most common causes]:
1. ‚úÖ Missing import
2. ‚úÖ Type mismatch
3. ‚úÖ Incorrect Effect signature
4. ‚úÖ Schema definition issue

### Fix: [Issue]

**Problem**: [Specific problem]

**Solution**:
\`\`\`typescript
// Add this import
import { [missing import] } from "effect"

// Fix this type
const foo: [correct type] = ...
\`\`\`

### Verification
After fixing:
\`\`\`bash
npm run build
# Should output: Build successful
\`\`\`

If other errors appear, share them and I'll help!
